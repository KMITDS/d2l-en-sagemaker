    "1. What are the problems you might encounter if you wanted to extend `autograd` to second derivatives? How would you fix them?\n",
    "1.  Why is the `reshape` function needed in the `squared_loss` function?\n",
    "1. Experiment using different learning rates to find out how fast the loss function value drops.\n",
    "1. If the number of examples cannot be divided by the batch size, what happens to the `data_iter` function's behavior?\n",
