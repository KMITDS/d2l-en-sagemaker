We add an MLP attention layer (`MLPAttention`) which has the same hidden size as the LSTM layer in the decoder. Then we initialize the state of the decoder by passing three items from the encoder:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **the encoder outputs of all timesteps**: they are used as the attention layer's memory with identical keys and values;\n",
    "\n",

    "At each timestep of the decoding, we use the output of the decoder's last RNN layer as the query for the attention layer. The attention model's output is then concatenated with the input embedding vector to feed into the RNN layer. Although the RNN layer hidden state also contains history information from decoder, the attention output explicitly selects the encoder outputs based on `enc_valid_len`, so that the attention output suspends other irrelevant information.\n",
