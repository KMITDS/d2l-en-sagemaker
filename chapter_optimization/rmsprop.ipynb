    "# RMSProp\n",
    "\n",
    ":label:`sec_rmsprop`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key issues in :numref:`sec_adagrad` is that the learning rate decreases at a predefined schedule of effectively $\\mathcal{O}(t^{-\\frac{1}{2}})$. While this is generally appropriate for convex problems, it might not be ideal for nonconvex ones, such as those encountered in deep learning. Yet, the coordinate-wise adaptivity of Adagrad is highly desirable as a preconditioner.\n",
    "\n",
    ":cite:`Tieleman.Hinton.2012` proposed the RMSProp algorithm as a simple fix to decouple rate scheduling from coordinate-adaptive learning rates. The issue is that Adagrad accumulates the squares of the gradient $\\mathbf{g}_t$ into a state vector $\\mathbf{s}_t = \\mathbf{s}_{t-1} + \\mathbf{g}_t^2$. As a result $\\mathbf{s}_t$ keeps on growing without bound due to the lack of normalization, essentially linarly as the algorithm converges.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of fixing this problem would be to use $\\mathbf{s}_t / t$. For reasonable distributions of $\\mathbf{g}_t$ this will converge. Unfortunately it might take a very long time until the limit behavior starts to matter since the procedure remembers the full trajectory of values. An alternative is to use a leaky average in the same way we used in the momentum method, i.e., $\\mathbf{s}_t \\leftarrow \\gamma \\mathbf{s}_{t-1} + (1-\\gamma) \\mathbf{g}_t^2$ for some parameter $\\gamma > 0$. Keeping all other parts unchanged yields RMSProp.\n",

    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The constant $\\epsilon > 0$ is typically set to $10^{-6}$ to ensure that we don't suffer from division by zero or overly large step sizes. Given this expansion we are now free to control the learning rate $\\eta$ independently of the scaling that is applied on a per-coordinate basis. In terms of leaky averages we can apply the same reasoning as previously applied in the case of the momentum method. Expanding the definition of $\\mathbf{s}_t$ yields\n",

Hence the sum of weights is normalized to $1$ with a half-life time of an observation of $\\gamma^{-1}$. Let's visualize the weights for the past 40 timesteps for various choices of $\\gamma$."

    "* RMSProp is very similar to Adagrad insofar as both use the square of the gradient to scale coefficients.\n",
    "* RMSProp shares with momentum the leaky averaging. However, RMSProp uses the technique to adjust the coefficient-wise preconditioner.\n",
