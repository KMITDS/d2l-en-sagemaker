    ":label:`sec_lstm`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge to address long-term information preservation and short-term input\n",
    "skipping in latent variable models has existed for a long time. One of the\n",
    "earliest approaches to address this was the LSTM\n",
    ":cite:`Hochreiter.Schmidhuber.1997`.  It shares many of the properties of the\n",
    "Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). Interestingly, LSTM's design is slightly more complex than GRU but predates GRU by almost two decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arguably it is inspired by logic gates of a computer. To control a memory cell\n",
    "we need a number of gates. One gate is needed to read out the entries from the\n",
    "cell (as opposed to reading any other cell). We will refer to this as the\n",
    "*output* gate. A second gate is needed to decide when to read data into the\n",
    "cell. We refer to this as the *input* gate. Last, we need a mechanism to reset\n",
    "the contents of the cell, governed by a *forget* gate. The motivation for such a\n",
    "design is the same as before, namely to be able to decide when to remember and\n",
    "when to ignore inputs in the latent state via a dedicated mechanism. Let's see\n",
    "how this works in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gated Memory Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "Three gates are introduced in LSTMs: the input gate, the forget gate, and the output gate. In addition to that we will introduce the memory cell that has the same shape as the hidden state. Strictly speaking this is just a fancy version of a hidden state, engineered to record additional information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Gates, Forget Gates, and Output Gates\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like with GRUs, the data feeding into the LSTM gates is the input at the current timestep $\\mathbf{X}_t$ and the hidden state of the previous timestep $\\mathbf{H}_{t-1}$. These inputs are processed by a fully connected layer and a sigmoid activation function to compute the values of input, forget and output gates. As a result, the three gates all output values in the range of $[0, 1]$. :numref:`lstm_0` illustrates the data flow for the input, forget, and output gates.\n",

    "\n",
    ":label:`lstm_0`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that there are $h$ hidden units, the minibatch is of size $n$, and number of inputs is $d$. Thus, the input is $\\mathbf{X}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ and the hidden state of the last timestep is $\\mathbf{H}_{t-1} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times h}$. Correspondingly, the gates are defined as follows: the input gate is $\\mathbf{I}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times h}$, the forget gate is $\\mathbf{F}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times h}$, and the output gate is $\\mathbf{O}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times h}$. They are calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\mathbf{I}_t &= \\sigma(\\mathbf{X}_t \\mathbf{W}_{xi} + \\mathbf{H}_{t-1} \\mathbf{W}_{hi} + \\mathbf{b}_i),\\\\\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Candidate Memory Cell\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we design the memory cell. Since we have not specified the action of the various gates yet, we first introduce the *candidate* memory cell $\\tilde{\\mathbf{C}}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times h}$. Its computation is similar to the three gates described above, but using a $\\tanh$ function with a value range for $[-1, 1]$ as the activation function. This leads to the following equation at timestep $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tilde{\\mathbf{C}}_t = \\text{tanh}(\\mathbf{X}_t \\mathbf{W}_{xc} + \\mathbf{H}_{t-1} \\mathbf{W}_{hc} + \\mathbf{b}_c).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $\\mathbf{W}_{xc} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times h}$ and $\\mathbf{W}_{hc} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{h \\times h}$ are weight parameters and $\\mathbf{b}_c \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times h}$ is a bias parameter.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Memory Cell\n",
    "\n",
    "In GRUs, we had a single mechanism to govern input and forgetting. Here in LSTMs we have two parameters, $\\mathbf{I}_t$ which governs how much we take new data into account via $\\tilde{\\mathbf{C}}_t$ and the forget parameter $\\mathbf{F}_t$ which addresses how much of the old memory cell content $\\mathbf{C}_{t-1} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times h}$ we retain. Using the same pointwise multiplication trick as before, we arrive at the following update equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{C}_t = \\mathbf{F}_t \\odot \\mathbf{C}_{t-1} + \\mathbf{I}_t \\odot \\tilde{\\mathbf{C}}_t.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the forget gate is always approximately $1$ and the input gate is always approximately $0$, the past memory cells $\\mathbf{C}_{t-1}$ will be saved over time and passed to the current timestep. This design was introduced to alleviate the vanishing gradient problem and to better capture dependencies for time series with long range dependencies. We thus arrive at the flow diagram in :numref:`lstm_2`.\n",

    "### Hidden States\n",
    "\n",
    "Last, we need to define how to compute the hidden state $\\mathbf{H}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times h}$. This is where the output gate comes into play. In LSTM it is simply a gated version of the $\\tanh$ of the memory cell. This ensures that the values of $\\mathbf{H}_t$ are always in the interval $(-1, 1)$. Whenever the output gate is $1$ we effectively pass all memory information through to the predictor, whereas for output $0$ we retain all the information only within the memory cell and perform no further processing. :numref:`lstm_3` has a graphical illustration of the data flow.\n",

Many variants thereof have been proposed over the years, e.g., multiple layers, residual connections, different types of regularization.
