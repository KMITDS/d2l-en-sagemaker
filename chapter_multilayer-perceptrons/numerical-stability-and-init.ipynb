    "In the past few sections, each model that we implemented\n",
    "required initializing our parameters according to some specified distribution.\n",
    "However, until now, we glossed over the details,\n",
    "taking the initialization hyperparameters for granted.\n",
    "You might even have gotten the impression that these choices\n",
    "are not especially important.\n",
    "However, the choice of initialization scheme\n",
    "plays a significant role in neural network learning,\n",
    "and can prove essentially to maintaining numerical stability.\n",
    "Moreover, these choices can be tied up in interesting ways\n",
    "with the choice of the activation function.\n",
    "Which nonlinear activation function we choose,\n",
    "and how we decide to initialize our parameters\n",
    "can play a crucial role in making\n",
    "the optimization algorithm converge rapidly.\n",
    "Failure to be mindful of these issues\n",

    "## Vanishing and Exploding Gradients\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a deep network with $d$ layers,\n",
    "input $\\mathbf{x}$ and output $\\mathbf{o}$.\n",
    "Each layer satisfies:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{h}^{t+1} = f_t (\\mathbf{h}^t) \\text{ and thus } \\mathbf{o} = f_d \\circ \\ldots, \\circ f_1(\\mathbf{x}).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If all activations and inputs are vectors,\n",
    "we can write the gradient of $\\mathbf{o}$\n",
    "with respect to any set of parameters $\\mathbf{W}_t$\n",
    "associated with the function $f_t$ at layer $t$ simply as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\partial_{\\mathbf{W}_t} \\mathbf{o} = \\underbrace{\\partial_{\\mathbf{h}^{d-1}} \\mathbf{h}^d}_{:= \\mathbf{M}_d} \\cdot \\ldots, \\cdot \\underbrace{\\partial_{\\mathbf{h}^{t}} \\mathbf{h}^{t+1}}_{:= \\mathbf{M}_t} \\underbrace{\\partial_{\\mathbf{W}_t} \\mathbf{h}^t}_{:= \\mathbf{v}_t}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, it is the product of $d-t$ matrices\n",
    "$\\mathbf{M}_d \\cdot \\ldots, \\cdot \\mathbf{M}_t$\n",

    "What happens is similar to the situation\n",
    "when we experienced numerical underflow\n",
    "when multiplying too many probabilities.\n",
    "At the time, we were able to mitigate the problem\n",
    "by switching from into log-space, i.e., by shifting the problem\n",
    "from the mantissa to the exponent of the numerical representation. Unfortunately the problem outlined in the equation above is much more serious:\n",
    "initially the matrices $M_t$ may well have a wide variety of eigenvalues.\n",
    "They might be small, they might be large, and in particular,\n",
    "their product might well be *very large* or *very small*.\n",
    "This is not (only) a problem of numerical representation\n",
    "but it means that the optimization algorithm is bound to fail.\n",
    "It receives gradients that are either\n",
    "excessively large or excessively small.\n",
    "As a result the steps taken are either\n",
    "(i) excessively large (the *exploding* gradient problem),\n",
    "in which case the parameters blow up in magnitude rendering the model useless,\n",

    "\n",
    "One major culprit in the vanishing gradient problem\n",

    "\n",
    "One way of addressing, or at least mitigating the issues raised above\n",

    "In the previous sections, e.g., in :numref:`sec_linear_gluon`,\n",

    "to initialize the values of our weights.\n",
    "If the initialization method is not specified,\n",

    "but let's proceed with the somewhat unrealistic assumption\n",
    "that they also have zero mean and variance $\\gamma^2$\n",

    "albeit with gradients being propagated from the top layers.\n",
    "That is, instead of $\\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{w}$,\n",
    "we need to deal with $\\mathbf{W}^\\top \\mathbf{g}$,\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{g}$ is the incoming gradient from the layer above.\n",
    "Using the same reasoning as for forward propagation,\n",
    "we see that the gradients' variance can blow up\n",
    "unless $n_\\mathrm{out} \\sigma^2 = 1$.\n",

    "### Beyond\n",
    "\n",
    "The reasoning above barely scratches the surface\n",
    "of modern approaches to parameter initialization.\n",
    "In fact, MXNet has an entire `mxnet.initializer` module\n",
    "implementing over a dozen different heuristics.\n",
    "Moreover, initialization continues to be a hot area of inquiry\n",
    "within research into the fundamental theory of neural network optimization.\n",
    "Some of these heuristics are especially suited\n",
    "for when parameters are tied\n",
    "(i.e., when parameters of in different parts the network are shared),\n",
    "for super-resolution, sequence models, and related problems.\n",
    "We recommend that the interested reader take a closer look\n",
    "at what is offered as part of this module,\n",
    "and investigate the recent research on parameter initialization.\n",
    "Perhaps you may come across a recent clever idea\n",
    "and contribute its implementation to MXNet,\n",
    "or you may even invent your own scheme!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* Vanishing and exploding gradients are common issues in very deep networks, unless great care is taking to ensure that gradients and parameters remain well controlled.\n",
    "* Initialization heuristics are needed to ensure that at least the initial gradients are neither too large nor too small.\n",
    "* The ReLU addresses one of the vanishing gradient problems, namely that gradients vanish for very large inputs. This can accelerate convergence significantly.\n",
    "* Random initialization is key to ensure that symmetry is broken before optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Can you design other cases of symmetry breaking besides the permutation symmetry?\n",
    "1. Can we initialize all weight parameters in linear regression or in softmax regression to the same value?\n",
    "1. Look up analytic bounds on the eigenvalues of the product of two matrices. What does this tell you about ensuring that gradients are well conditioned?\n",
    "1. If we know that some terms diverge, can we fix this after the fact? Look at the paper on LARS for inspiration :cite:`You.Gitman.Ginsburg.2017`.\n",
