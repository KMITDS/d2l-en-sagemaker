    "* Real data often contains a mix of different data types and needs to be preprocessed.\n",
    "* Rescaling real-valued data to zero mean and unit variance is a good default. So is replacing missing values with their mean.\n",
    "* Transforming categorical variables into indicator variables allows us to treat them like vectors.\n",

    "1. Submit your predictions for this tutorial to Kaggle. How good are your predictions?\n",
    "1. Can you improve your model by minimizing the log-price directly? What happens if you try to predict the log price rather than the price?\n",
    "1. Is it always a good idea to replace missing values by their mean? Hint: can you construct a situation where the values are not missing at random?\n",
    "1. Find a better representation to deal with missing values. Hint: what happens if you add an indicator variable?\n",
    "1. Improve the score on Kaggle by tuning the hyperparameters through k-fold cross-validation.\n",
    "1. Improve the score by improving the model (layers, regularization, dropout).\n",
    "1. What happens if we do not standardize the continuous numerical features like we have done in this section?\n",
